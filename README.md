# Fibonacci Sequence Generator üåÄ

This Java program generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.

## Introduction ‚ÑπÔ∏è

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. This program calculates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Customizable Number of Terms**: Change the value of `numTerms` to generate a different number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.
- **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-understand Java program with clear instructions.

## Usage üñ•Ô∏è

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile the `FibonacciSequenceGenerator.java` file.
3. Run the compiled Java program.
4. Follow the instructions to specify the number of terms for the Fibonacci sequence.
5. The program will generate and display the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified number of terms.

## Example

```bash
$ javac Fibonacci.java
$ java Fibonacci
Enter the number of terms: 10
Fibonacci Sequence of 10 terms:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
